# Kingfisher Direct - Order Orig Product SKU

This module adds product_sku property to order items (Quote item and Sales Order Item).

By default magento saves product sku with all options.

This is a module with similar functionality to https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/30667 , which as of today seems to be targeted for Magento 2.5

## Tests

At the moment this software was manually tested on Magento 2.3.5.
